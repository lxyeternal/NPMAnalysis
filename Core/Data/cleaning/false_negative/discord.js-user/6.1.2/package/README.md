## About
discord.js is a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to interact with the
[Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) very easily.

> Recently, some features were removed from the library, like those that were used to manage selfbots.

We created this fork of the discord.js library to enhance the way people work and interact with the Discord API, by restoring functions such as `acceptInvite()`, or `guildCreate()`, and many others.

## Installation
**Node.js 8.0.0 or newer is required.**  
Ignore any warnings about unmet peer dependencies, as they're all optional.

#### Optional packages
- [zlib-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zlib-sync) for significantly faster WebSocket data inflation (`npm install zlib-sync`)
- [erlpack](https://github.com/discordapp/erlpack) for significantly faster WebSocket data (de)serialisation (`npm install discordapp/erlpack`)
- One of the following packages can be installed for faster voice packet encryption and decryption:
    - [sodium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium) (`npm install sodium`)
    - [libsodium.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsodium-wrappers) (`npm install libsodium-wrappers`)
- [uws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uws) for a much faster WebSocket connection (`npm install uws`)
- [bufferutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for a much faster WebSocket connection when *not* using uws (`npm install bufferutil`)

## Example usage
```js
const Discord = require('discord.js-user');
const client = new Discord.Client();

client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);

  client.user.createGuild({params}).then(guild => {
    console.log(`Guild ${guild.name} created!`);
  }) // Creates a guild, see documentation for params

  client.user.acceptInvite('invite');
  // Joins a guild by following an invite link / code.
});

client.login('token');
```
